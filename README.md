## Automating Mikrotik Device Configuration with Ansible

ansible-mikrotik enables network engineers to automate the configuration and management of [Mikrotik](https://mikrotik.com) devices. By leveraging Ansibleâ€™s idempotent execution model, this role simplifies network operations, minimizes manual errors, and streamlines deployment in dynamic network environments.

---

## Features

- **Automated Configuration:** Quickly deploy and update Mikrotik device settings including interfaces, routing, firewall rules, and VPN configurations.
- **Idempotence:** Ensure configurations are applied consistently without unintended changes.
- **Customizable Variables:** Easily override defaults to suit your configuration requirements.
- **Modular Design:** Clean separation between tasks, defaults, and configuration files for easy maintenance and extension.
- **Dynamic Inventory Support:** Integrate with your existing dynamic inventory setups. (coming soon)

---

## Requirements

- **Network Device Access:** Ensure connectivity between your Ansible control node and the Mikrotik devices for ssh (Port: 22) and api-access (Port: 8728) or ssl-api (Port: 8729).

---

## Setup

To run completely in your browser use [codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces)

**Be patient while the environment is spinnung up for the first time since it needs to pull some MBytes of containers for the system to be up and running (2-5 Minutes)**

To run locally without any need for software installation using [devpods](https://devpod.sh). 

**WARNING for Apple Silicon users (ARM based MACs) also wanting to try the lab: The containerlab with Mikrotik docker image that is provided for the lab is build with [vrnetlab](https://github.com/vrnetlab/vrnetlab/tree/master/routeros) and does not yet support ARM based MACs. You should use github codespaces instead for now!**


### Local installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/narrowin/ansible-mikrotik.git
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $> pip install -r requirements.txt
(venv) $> ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml -p collections/
```

To install contgainerlab for testing the playbooks follow: [containerlab docs](https://containerlab.dev/quickstart/)

## Running and testing the playbooks

### Quick start options with containerlab

Spin up labs in the [containerlabs](containerlabs) folder to test ansible playbooks with no local software dependencies - fully self-contained environment with a lab topology, ansible and this repo installed. All batteries included!

The labs provided by this repo are:

- [three Mikrotik nodes and two Linux clients](containerlabs/simple.clab.yml)
- [single Mikrotik node to test with](containerlabs/simple.clab.yml) - to run this with ansible you need to enable the clab-simple-n1 definition in [inventory/mikrotik](inventory/mikrotik)

#### Start containerlab from the terminal
```bash
# start the three node lab
clab deploy -t containerlabs/s3n.clab.yml
```

#### Start containerlab from the [VS-Code extension](https://containerlab.dev/manual/vsc-extension/)

Navigate on the left to containerlab. Right click on the lab you want to start and choose `Deploy`

## Configuration when running against other Mikrotik devices

[Key configuration options](group_vars/all.yml) include:

- **mikrotik_user:** Username for authentication.
- **mikrotik_password:** Password for authentication.
- **local_backups_top_folder:** Path to local backup folder on the ansible control host
- **Additional Settings:** Customize dns, ntp, snmp and otgher configurations according to your environment.

All [behavioral inventory parameters](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#connecting-to-hosts-behavioral-inventory-parameters) are defined in [inventory/mikrotik](inventory/mikrotik). 
Check this file to identify the IPs for all switches and how to connect to them.

*Connecting Requirements:*  

```conole
[Ansible Playbook] --> [Mikrotik RouterOS API]
[Ansible Playbook] --> [Mikrotik RouterOS SSL-API]
[Ansible Playbook] --> [Mikrotik RouterOS SSH] # some playbooks directly connect via ssh/scp
```

---

## Running and testing the ansible playbooks

### Backup config of mikrotik switches

```bash
# three node setup
ansible-playbook playbooks/mikrotik-backup-config.yml --limit mikrotik_s3n
```

Mikrotik config files will be stored in the ansible control host in `backups/` unless reconfigured in [group_vars/all.yml](group_vars/all.yml)

### Backup system files mikrotik switches

```bash
# three node setup
ansible-playbook playbooks/mikrotik-backup-system.yml --limit mikrotik_s3n
```

Mikrotik system files will be stored in the ansible control host in `playbook-network-switches/backups/`

### mikrotik file transfers

Be aware that ansible-pyblibssh won't work to transfer files from/to the mikrotik devices using ansible module `ansible.netcommon.net_get`.
You have to install the packages defined in `requirements.txt` inside your venv (paramiko + scp)

### Full device configuration

#### Ansible dry run and show diff

```bash
# three node setup
ansible-playbook playbooks/mikrotik-configure.yml --limit mikrotik_s3n --check --diff
```

#### Push config

```bash
# three node setup
ansible-playbook playbooks/mikrotik-configure.yml --limit mikrotik_s3n
```

run the playbook twice and see the wonders of idempotency (:

#### Push only specific parts/tags

E.g.: bridge_ports in [playbook/mirotik-configure.yml](playbook/mirotik-configure.yml)

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/mikrotik-configure.yml --limit mikrotik_s3n -t bridge_ports
```

---

## Login to Lab devices

Switches - User: admin - Password: multi00l

```bash
ssh admin@clab
```

Linux clients - User: user Password: multi00l

```bash
ssh user@clab-s3n-linux1 
```

---

## Debugging

### Check the ansible groups for a device in the inventory

```bash
# all groups
ansible -m debug -a var="hostvars[inventory_hostname]['group_names']" sw-mkt-cluster-05
```

```bash
# all vars
ansible -m debug -a "var=vars" clab-simple-n1
```

---

## Caveats

### Details about bonding

Make sure the members of a bond don't belong to the bridge. This requires the right order in the playbook. You should first execute the task

- configuring the bridge so the right interfaces are added/removed from/to the bridge

- **afterwards** you can execute the task configuring the bond.

### Details about trunk ports

Every trunk port should have `bpdu_guard: no` in `interface_brige_ports.yml`

### common error

```console
TASK [Bond] **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
fatal: [sw-mkt-03]: FAILED! => changed=false
  msg: 'Error while creating entry for name="uplink-bond": failure: sfp-sfpplus3 already in bridge'
  changed: [sw-mkt-02]
```

This happens because the interfaces were manually added to the bridge during the initial setup. To fix it login to the switch and:

```console
[user@sw-mkt-03] /interface/bridge/port> print     
...
some output 
...
56  H sfp-sfpplus1  bridge  yes     1  0x80             10                  10  none   
;;; defconf
57  H sfp-sfpplus2  bridge  yes     1  0x80             10                  10  none   
;;; defconf
58 IH sfp-sfpplus3  bridge  yes     1  0x80             10                  10  none   
;;; defconf
59 IH sfp-sfpplus4  bridge  yes     1  0x80             10                  10  none   

# delete the physical interfaces that are part of the new bond from the bridge
[user@sw-mkt-03] /interface/bridge/port> remove numbers=56,57,58,59

```

### How to enable API with SSL in mikrotik devices

First generate the required SSL certs executing `ansible-playbook playbooks/mikrotik-generate-ssl-certs.yml`

Once you have the certs you can upload them to the devices and enable the API executing `ansible-playbook playbooks/mikrotik-generate-ssl-certs.yml`

### Authentication with ssh-key and ansible-vault

Use ssh-keys for authentication for login on the network devices.

- private ssh key used for authentication should be located e.g. in `~/.ssh/id_rsa` # configure in mikrotik group_vars

- Use ansible-vault to provide login- and API-credentials. This addition helps in daily operations to keep the credentials in a securere standard place.

- ansible vault password should be stored in a text file in `playbook-network-switches/.vault.pass`

*Happy automating!*
